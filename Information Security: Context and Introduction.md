##  Topic: Reading: Information Security - What's that?
What is information security? 
*Information* can be considered as some meaning conveyed by a sequence of symbols. The symbols can be alphabetics which is characters, numbers, punctuations etc. Or it could be, for example, a genetic sequence and can be physical or logical. So a book or something on a computer. 
We often use *information security* in the context of computer systems. In recent years, the term *cyber security* has been coined. So, the association of computer machinery has a joint task force which is defining cyber security. They define it as a computing-based discipline involving technology, people, information, and processes to enable assured operations of an organization. It involves the creation, the operations, analysis and testing of secure computer systems. It is an interdisciplinary course of study, which includes aspects of law, policy, human factors, ethics, and risk management in the context of adversaries. From the definitions, we can see that information security is broader or wider than cyber security. Although today, much of information security is, of course, framed within the context of cyber security.
